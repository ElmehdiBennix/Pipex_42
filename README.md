The UNIX operating system is a popular choice for developers and system administrators alike, thanks to its flexibility and robustness. One of the key mechanisms in UNIX is the use of system calls, which allow programs to interact with the operating system kernel and perform a wide range of tasks. This project aims to let developers explore and understand one of these mechanisms in detail, by using it in their own programs.
